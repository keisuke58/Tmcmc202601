Abstract An established strategy for material modeling is provided by energy-based principles such that
evolution equations in terms of ordinary differential equations can be derived. However, there exist a variety
of material models that also need to take into account non-local effects to capture microstructure evolution. In
this case, the evolution of microstructure is described by a partial differential equation. In this contribution,
we present how Hamilton’s principle provides a physically sound strategy for the derivation of transient
ﬁeld equations for all state variables. Therefore, we begin with a demonstration how Hamilton’s principle
generalizes the principle of stationary action for rigid bodies. Furthermore, we show that the basic idea behind
Hamilton’s principle is not restricted to isothermal mechanical processes. In contrast, we propose an extended
Hamilton principle which is applicable to coupled problems and dissipative microstructure evolution. As
example, we demonstrate how the ﬁeld equations for all state variables for thermo-mechanically coupled
problems, i.e., displacements, temperature, and internal variables, result from the stationarity of the extended
Hamilton functional. The relation to other principles, as the principle of virtual work and Onsager’s principle,
is given. Finally, exemplary material models demonstrate how to use the extended Hamilton principle for
thermo-mechanically coupled elastic, gradient-enhanced, rate-dependent, and rate-independent materials.

1 Introduction
Physical bodies are described by a varying number of state variables. For instance, two state variables are
necessary in a thermo-mechanical sense: displacements u and temperature θ. Other problems could be chemo-
mechanical ones with the displacements and the concentration of substances, electro-mechanical ones with the
displacements and the electric ﬁeld, or combinations of the latter. Particularly for solids, these state variables,
however, do not carry enough information to reﬂect the total state. The important inﬂuence of microstructure
and its time-dependent conﬁguration is not accounted for, i.e., for thermo-mechanically coupled problems, by
the primary state variables u and θ. To overcome this deﬁciency, additional variables for the “inner state” were
introduced between 1820 and 1850 by Carnot, Joule, and Clausius [ 9,12,28]. More details on the history are
g i v e ni n[27]. These variables are nowadays referred to as internal variables which might be denoted, arbitrarily,

by the vector α. Then, the set {u,θ, α} completely describes the physical state of thermo-mechanically cou-
pled problems and dissipative microstructure evolution. Appropriate choices for α mimic the experimentally
observed material conﬁguration. However, a sophisticated challenge of modern mechanics is the develop-
ment of mathematical equations that describe how the microstructural state, given in terms of α,e v o l v e s .
Consequently, these equations are referred to as evolution equations and form the material model. Herein, a
material-speciﬁc choice ofα deﬁnes answers to questions as is it a plastic strain, a volume fraction, a hardening
or damage variable, or others.
Along with the choice which set of internal variables shall be used in the material model, the identiﬁcation
of constraints from experimentally observed material behavior is a crucial step during the derivation of a
related mathematical description of the material behavior. Then, the consideration of the constraints in terms
of mathematical formulas often turns out to be a non-trivial issue. It is thus convenient to derive material
models from a potential which might comprise several beneﬁts: ensurance of thermodynamic consistency
and simpliﬁed consideration of constraints by using appropriate Lagrange parameters. One potential-based
principle of material modeling is the principle of maximum dissipation. Here, the dissipation, being a function
of the thermodynamic driving forces p, is maximized to derive the evolution equations. The assumption
that (microstructural) processes maximize the dissipation is physically sound and, consequently, material
models that are derived by using this approach agree to the fundamental laws of physics. A similar potential-
based principle is given by the so-called principle of the minimum of the dissipation potential. In contrast
to the principle of maximum dissipation, the potential is here a function of the thermodynamic ﬂux ˙α such
that minimizing the dissipation potential directly results in the evolution equations. A subsequent Legendre
transformation of the associated dissipation function allows to identify the related yield function /Phi1if rate-
independent processes are modeled.
It is obvious that a model for a speciﬁc material should be able to describe the related processes with
sufﬁcient accuracy and, of course, must not contradict fundamental physical observations and their related
laws. These requirements still provide a huge variety to construct a speciﬁc material model. For instance, the
relation
˙α ∝ p (1)
is often used for rate-dependent processes. This proportionality between the thermodynamic driving force p,
which can be derived from the free energy density /Psi1by
p := − ∂/Psi1
∂α , (2)
and the thermodynamic ﬂux ˙α routes back to Onsager and is consequently known as Onsager’s principle. In
case of rate-independent processes, materials are modeled by deﬁning a suitable yield function /Phi1,a n dt h e
evolution of the internal variable is assumed to be obtained from a thermodynamic extremal principle, e.g.,
principle of maximum dissipation or principle of the minimum of the dissipation potential, yielding
˙α ∝ ∂/Phi1
∂p (3)
This procedure has proven to be beneﬁcial when quasi-static processes evolve. Whereas for appropriate choices
for /Phi1and using Onsager’s principle, it can be shown that such material models are thermodynamically sound
by construction, the veriﬁcation of the latter is usually a part of the derivation of a material model if other
modeling techniques are employed. Here, the Coleman–Noll procedure is used for the identiﬁcation of the
driving forces and thermodynamic consistency is proved by checking the dissipation inequality
p · ˙α ≥ 0 . (4)
However, a drawback of these potential-based approaches is that they are not suitable for the derivation of ﬁeld
equations for the internal variable. To be more precise, the inclusion of gradient terms is not possible since the
principle of maximum dissipation and the principle of the minimum of the dissipation potential are both deﬁned
locally for a material point. A solution to this drawback is given by Hamilton’s principle: it is formulated as
variational problem for the entire physical body. Thus, ﬁeld equations, i.e., partial differential equations in
time and space, can be derived from related stationarity conditions. Hamilton’s principle is strongly related to
the principle of stationary action and comprises the principle of virtual work and the principle of the minimum
of the dissipation potential, which all turn out to be special cases of Hamilton’s principle.

In this contribution, we aim at highlighting the relation of Hamilton’s principle to the fundamental laws
of thermodynamics and other extremal principles of continuum mechanics. We begin with a short overview
on the history of material modeling and give a brief introduction to thermodynamics. Later, we recall the
principle of stationary action and demonstrate its relation to the 1
st law of thermodynamics. This serves as
basis to present how a generalization of the principle of stationary action, which is originally restricted to rigid
particles, can be used to describe non-conservative deformable solids. Particularly, we show that an extended
Hamilton principle thus might be used for the derivation of material models including ﬁeld equations for all
state variables in thermo-mechanically coupled problems given by {u,θ, α}. Finally, we show basic examples
of thermo-mechanically coupled material models based on the extended Hamilton principle.
2 Brief outline of the history of material modeling
Material modeling comprises the usage of internal variables and strategies to derive governing equations for
describing their evolution. A prominent modeling strategy is the application of variational methods which were
invented far earlier than the concept of internal variables, see [27]. The idea of some quantity that is maximized
or minimized by physical processes roots back to Aristotle or even before, cf. [ 5]. It is strongly related to the
principle of stationary action which was embedded into a rigorous mathematical concept in the late 1700s by
Leibniz, Euler, Maupertuis, Lagrange, and others, see [ 50]. The invention of variational calculus allowed to
solve the problem of brachistochrone as well as light refraction, the motion of a conservative oscillator, and
many more. A related approach is the well-known principle of Castigliano and Menabrea [ 11,40]. A historical
review is presented in [ 8]. Hamilton generalized the principle of stationary action in [ 25,26]. More details
on Hamilton’s principle are given by Bedford [ 4] and Bailey [ 2] who presents a clear distinction of different
energy-based extremal principles.
The usage of internal variables in current sense routes back to the concept of “variables of inner state”
as pioneered by Carnot [ 9], Joule [ 28], and Clausius [ 12]. Afterwards, the concept was put in a sound ther-
modynamic framework by Helmholtz [ 56], Thomson [ 54], Maxwell [ 39], Gibbs [ 20], and Duhem [ 17]( s e e
[27]a n d[ 38] for a detailed historical presentation). In 1931, Onsager used the thermodynamic approach of
thermodynamic ﬂuxes ˙α and thermodynamic forces p. Starting from the (reduced) Clausius–Duhem inequality
p · ˙α ≥ 0 , (5)
he postulated a proportionality which served as fundamental ansatz for material modeling since it fulﬁlls
thermodynamic consistency a priori [ 46,47]. Roughly at the same time, the concept of thermodynamic ﬂuxes
and forces was conveyed to continuum mechanics by Bridgman [7] and Eckart [18]. A time-dependent evolution
was investigated in the general work by Ziegler [ 57]. The thermodynamics of irreversible processes was put
in the 1960s into a more rigorous mathematical framework by Truesdell [ 55] and Coleman and Noll [ 13–15]
who established so-called rational thermodynamics. A further elaboration by Rice [
51] and Lubliner [ 33]
founded in the 1970s the concept of internal variables in its current form. The concept of maximum dissipation
as fundamental strategy for the derivation of evolution equations was given by Lubliner in 1984 [ 34]a n d
Simo in 1988 [ 52]. A concept for complex microstructures was proposed by Ortiz and Repetto in their work
on non-convex energy minimization [ 48] which built upon the mathematical basis of Ball and James [ 3].
An alternative for the principle of maximum dissipation was introduced by the principle of the minimum
of the dissipation potential, published in various forms, e.g., by Martin, Maier, Halphen, Maugin and Hackl
[21,24,35–37]. A comparison between the two approaches was given in [ 22]. Strategies to couple the local
material behavior to non-local ﬁelds can be given by the introduction of penalty terms, see, e.g., [ 16], or by
postulating evolution equations that are added as constraints to the functional by using Lagrange parameters,
see, e.g., the works by Hackl and Fischer [19,23]. It is also worth mentioning that instead of a time-continuous
presentation, time-incremental variational methods for material modeling have been established. Examples are
given in a more numerical setting by Simo [ 53]. A more analytical setting is discussed by Mielke for the case
of ﬁnite elasto-plasticity in [ 43] based on dissipation distances and by Miehe who generalized this approach
to gradient-extended standard dissipative materials [ 42]. More details are also provided in the textbook by
Mielke in 2015 [ 44].

3 Thermodynamic basis
In this section, we recapitulate shortly the fundamentals of thermodynamics to deﬁne our notation and set the
basis for the description of the generalization of Hamilton’s principle. Here, we restrict ourselves to thermo-
mechanically coupled processes.
3.1 The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics postulates the balance of energy which states that the rate of the total energy
of the body equals the power due to mechanical and thermal loads. This can be recast in the equation
˙E + ˙K = Pmech + Ptherm (6)
where the internal energy is given by E and the kinetic energy by K; the mechanical power is given by Pmech
and the thermal power by Ptherm, cf. [1]. The same axiom is given, equivalently, after integrating (6) over time
by
E + K = W + Q + cint (7)
with the mechanical work W, the thermal work Q, and some integration constant cint. The internal energy
of the full body E consists of the total free energy
∫
ω /Psi1dv and the heat
∫
ω hin dv, i.e., energy contributions
which are neither related to external work nor mass transport. The heat is thus the amount of energy stored
in the thermal movement of the atoms and measured by h
in = ρθ¯s with the absolute temperature θ and the
mass-speciﬁc entropy ¯s = s/ρ. The entropy can accordingly be interpreted as temperature-speciﬁc energy
which, according to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, indicates the part of the internal energy that is not directly
accessible by mechanical processes. The internal energy is then given by
E =
∫
ω
ρ ¯/Psi1dv +
∫
ω
ρθ¯s dv =
∫
/Omega1
ρ ¯/Psi1J dV +
∫
/Omega1
ρθ¯sJ dV. (8)
Here, ¯/Psi1denotes the mass-speciﬁc free energy density and ρ the mass density. The material domain in the
current conﬁguration is termed as ω, whereas the material domain in the reference conﬁguration is indicated
by /Omega1. The transformation of the volume element in the current conﬁguration to its equivalence in the reference
conﬁguration is performed by d v = J dV with J := det F and the deformation gradient F := I + ∂u/∂X
with the identity tensor of second order I,s e e[1]. The spatial coordinate in the current conﬁguration is denoted
as x and in the reference conﬁguration as x(t = 0) = x(0) =: X. The free energy can be expressed by
∫
ω
/Psi1dv = E −
∫
ω
θs dv, (9)
while the kinetic energy is given by
K =
∫
ω

with the velocity ˙u. External forces can be divided into surface and body forces, indicated by the traction
vector t⋆ at the boundary of the body ∂ω and the mass-speciﬁc body force ¯b
⋆
. Then, the mechanical work W
is given by
W =
∫
∂ω
t⋆ · u da +
∫

whereas the mechanical power reads

see [ 1]. Here, σ denotes the Cauchy stress; the stretch rate tensor D := (L + LT )/2 is the symmetric part
of the spatial velocity gradient L := ∂v/∂x. It is worth mentioning that we use pure Neumann boundary

conditions, i.e., ∂ω = /Gamma1σ and /Gamma1u =∅ where /Gamma1σ denotes the boundary with prescribed tractions and /Gamma1u
denotes the boundary with prescribed displacements. However, the complete derivation which follows holds
true when also Dirichlet boundary conditions are used. We skip the straightforward inclusion of Dirichlet
boundary conditions here for a more convenient presentation. The material time derivative is deﬁned as
D
Dt := ∂
∂t + v · ∂
∂x . (13)
Thermal power is transferred into the system by the heat ﬂux vector q and generated within the system by the
external heat source ρ¯h. Let us deﬁne that the rate of the total energy of the body is increased when the heat
ﬂux vector is pointing into the body. Then, the thermal power is given by
Ptherm =−
∫
∂ω
q · n da +
∫
ω
ρ ¯h dv =−

∫

∇X · q(0) dV +
∫
/Omega1
ρ(0) ¯h dV (14)
where∇x·• ≡ div•indicates the divergence in the current conﬁguration. The superscript•(0) refers to quantities
evaluated in the reference conﬁguration and ρ(0) = J ρ. The divergence in the reference conﬁguration is
indicated by ∇X ·•≡ DIV•. Thus, the amount of thermal exchange of the body with its surrounding Q is
given by time integration of Ptherm which yields
Q =−
∫
/Omega1
∫
∇X · q(0) dt dV +
∫
/Omega1
∫
ρ(0) ¯h dt dV . (15)
Inserting the deﬁnitions for the internal energy E, the kinetic energy K, for the mechanical power Pmech and
the thermal power Ptherm into the balance of energy ( 6), we obtain the local form in the current conﬁguration
ρ ˙¯/Psi1+ ρ ˙(θs) = σ : D −∇ x · q + ρ ¯h (16)
and in the reference conﬁguration
ρ(0) ˙¯/Psi1+ ρ(0) ˙(θs) = P : ˙F −∇ X · q(0) + ρ(0) ¯h , (17)
see [1], which have to hold for arbitrary processes. Here, the 1 st Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor has been used
which is related to the Cauchy stress tensor by P = σ · cof F with the cofactor tensor cof F := J F− T
which transforms vectorial area elements from the reference conﬁguration, termed as d a(0), to the current
conﬁguration, termed as da,v i ada = cof F · da(0). Analogously, the heat ﬂux vectors in reference and current
conﬁguration are related by q(0) = q · cof F. It is worth mentioning that ( 16)a n d(17) give the energy balance
for thermo-mechanically coupled problems. In case of other coupled problems, i.e., for chemical or electrical
coupling, the energy balance has to be modiﬁed accordingly. For instance, the formulation of the free energy
and the interaction to the surrounding in terms of work or power have to be adapted.
For rigid particles in the isothermal case, the notation
U + K = W (18)
is usually introduced. Here, U denotes the potential energy, which is associated with the free energy of
continuous deformable solids, and K denotes the kinetic energy. The mechanical work is given by W =
W
in + W ex with the contributions W in and W ex due to internal and external forces, respectively.
3.2 The second law of thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics accounts for the observation that the ﬂow direction of heat is not universal:
two bodies of different temperatures will compensate their thermal difference by lowering the temperature
of the body with initially higher temperature to increase the temperature of the body with initially lower
temperature. This process is irreversible since a “segregation” of temperature does not take place.

The unidirectional ﬂow of heat is recast in mathematical terms by the condition that the heat-related energy
may only increase. This energy was identiﬁed to be the entropy such that Clausius’ theorem reads
D
Dt
∫
ω
ρ ¯s dv ≥ 0 . (19)
The entropy s may change in time due to entropy ﬂux qs, entropy source ρ ¯hs, and entropy production /Delta1s.
It is worth mentioning that precisely the entropy production /Delta1s accounts for dissipative processes which are
always path-dependent. Thus, the amount of entropy produced, termed as Ds, is not given by time integration
of the production term /Delta1s, i.e.,
Ds(t1) − Ds(t0) ̸=
∫ t1
t0
/Delta1s dt . (20)
The balance of entropy can be written as

where entropy ﬂux and entropy source are given by qs = q/θ and ¯hs = ¯h/θ, respectively, see, e.g., [1]. Then,
(21) locally demands, in the current conﬁguration,
ρ ˙¯s =− ∇ x ·

θ + /Delta1s = 1
θ2 q(0) ·∇ Xθ− 1
θ∇X · q(0) + ρ(0) ¯h
θ + /Delta1s (23)
in the reference conﬁguration.
The observation that mechanical energy can be transformed completely into heat but the reverse trans-
formation of heat into mechanical energy can only be performed partly, gives rise to deﬁne the dissipated
energy: it measures the amount of heat that cannot be transformed (back) into mechanical energy, thus into the
free energy density. The process of transformation of mechanical energy into non-recoverable thermal energy,
which is referred to as dissipation, can be described by restricting /Delta1
s ≥ 0. An idealized, reversible process
in which no dissipation takes place is identiﬁed by /Delta1s = 0; a more general case of irreversible processes is
identiﬁed by /Delta1s > 0.
Making use of /Delta1s ≥ 0, we reformulate ( 22) as follows:
ρ ˙¯s +∇ x · qs − ρ ¯hs = /Delta1s ≥ 0
⇒ ρ ˙¯s +∇ x · qs − ρ ¯hs ≥ 0
⇒ ρ ˙¯s ≥− ∇ x · qs + ρ ¯hs (24)
where (24) is the well-known Clausius–Duhem inequality [ 1].
Combination of the balance of entropy according to ( 22)a n d( 23), respectively, with the energy balance
in current or reference conﬁguration in ( 16)a n d( 17) gives rise to the modiﬁed form of the second law of
thermodynamics in the current conﬁguration as
θ/Delta1s = σ : D − ρ ˙¯/Psi1− ρ ˙θ¯s − 1
θq ·∇ xθ≥ 0 (25)
and in the reference conﬁguration as
θ/Delta1s = P : ˙F − ρ(0) ˙¯/Psi1− ρ(0) ˙θ¯s − 1
θq(0) ·∇ Xθ≥ 0 , (26)
respectively. Application of the Coleman–Noll procedure, which is equivalent to the standard argument of
dissipative media, results in the constitutive equations for the stresses
P = 2ρ(0) F · ∂¯/Psi1
∂C (27)

===== PAGE 7 =====

and entropy
¯s =− ∂¯/Psi1
∂θ . (28)
Furthermore, the relation
− 1
θq(0) ·∇ Xθ≥ 0 (29)
needs to be satisﬁed which can be directly fulﬁlled by Fourier’s law
q(0) =− λ∇Xθ (30)
with the heat conductivityλ> 0. Finally, the second law of thermodynamics reduces to the so-called dissipation
inequality
θ/Delta1s = p · ˙α > 0 (31)
which needs to be satisﬁed. Here, we used the deﬁnition of the thermodynamic driving force p as
p := −ρ(0) ∂¯/Psi1
∂α . (32)
It is important to mention that θ/Delta1s is not deﬁned by p· ˙α in (31): the entropy production remains an additional
quantity that needs to be modeled. Since the case of reversible processes in solids with /Delta1s = 0 was associated
with a non-evolving microstructure, i.e., ˙α = 0, it is obvious that for the present case of irreversible processes
the entropy production is related to the evolution of microstructure. Thus, in analogy to the assumption for
mechanical power in ( 12), it is convenient to postulate
/Delta1
s = ps · ˙α (33)
for the entropy production with the non-conservative forces ps that have to be speciﬁed for a speciﬁc material.
Provided that ˙α is known, it is worth mentioning that the non-conservative forces ps have to be modeled rather
than /Delta1s. Consequently, (31) transforms to the
Evolution equation for the internal variables α
ps = 1
θ p . (34)
This equation indicates that the thermodynamic driving force p and the non-conservative force ps are
in balance. It serves as condition to describe the non-conservative evolution of microstructure provided
that p
s has been chosen appropriately to the observed material behavior. It is worth mentioning that
this local investigation yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as evolution equation for α.
Note that in case of other couplings than thermo-mechanics the relations have to be adapted accordingly.
4 The principle of stationary action
Here, the basics of the principle of stationary action for rigid particles is shortly recapitulated to set the basis
for its generalization leading to Hamilton’s principle.

===== PAGE 8 =====
1938 P . Junker, D. Balzani
4.1 The action functional for rigid particles
Routing back to the pioneering works of Maupertuis and Euler, a variational approach to modeling the dynamic
behavior of physical systems was established by the axiom that the momentum integrated along the path a
rigid particle follows tends to be stationary. This can be recast in formulas as
A :=
∫ u1
u0
l · du → statu (35)
with the momentum vector
l = m ˙u (36)
for a rigid particle with mass m and velocity ˙u = du/dt. Here, the quantity A is referred to as action.
Accounting for the time dependence of the spatial coordinate, i.e., u = u(t) such that d u = ˙u dt, the action
can be reformulated as
A =
∫ t1
t0
m||˙u||2 dt . (37)
Making use of the kinetic energy
K = 1
2 m||˙u||2 , (38)
it can be concluded that the action turns into
A =
∫
τ
(K + K) dt (39)
with the arbitrary time interval τ= t1 − t0.
4.2 The principle of stationary action for conservative processes
The action can be brought to a form that is much more familiar in the context of modern mechanics. To this
end, energy conservation as ∫
τ
U dt +
∫
τ
K dt = 0( 4 0 )
is used to express “one” kinetic energy in A =
∫
τ(K + K) dt in (39)b y
∫
τ K dt =−
∫
τ U dt. Thus, the action
transforms to
A =
∫
τ
(K − U) dt . (41)
In contrast to the kinetic energy, the potential energy depends on the placement of the rigid particle given by
the deformation u. The velocity is, per se, not an additional quantity but can be computed from u such that the
principle of stationary action is speciﬁed to
A =
∫
τ
L dt → statu (42)
with the Lagrange function L := K − U . The necessary condition for A being stationary is
δA =
∫
τ
[ ∂L
∂˙u · δ˙u + ∂L
∂u · δu
]
dt = 0 ∀δu . (43)
Application of integration by parts and postulating δu|t0 = δu|t1 = 0 yields the so-called Lagrange equations
of 2nd kind, reading
d
dt
∂L
∂˙u − ∂L
∂u = 0 , (44)
which provides an equivalent formulation of Newton’s law
f cons = m ¨u (45)
with the conservative forces f cons.

4.3 The principle of stationary action for non-conservative processes
In many practical problems, the restriction to conservative particles is an inadmissible simpliﬁcation of the
physical reality. Therefore, non-conservative effects should also be taken into account in the principle of
stationary action. The necessary manipulation, however, is small: instead of using energy conservation, the
energy theorem
U + K = W
in + W ex (46)
is used with the work due to non-conservative internal and external forces, denoted by W in and W ex, respec-
tively. The work due to non-conservative internal forces is given byW in =− f in · u since the non-conservative
internal force f in points in opposite direction to the displacements u. The work due to non-conservative
external forces f ex is given by W ex = f ex · u. Consequently, the action functional transforms to
A =
∫
τ
(
K − U + W in + W ex)
dt =
∫
τ
(
L + W in + W ex)
dt → statu . (47)
The variation yields
δA =
∫
τ
[ ∂L
∂˙u · δ˙u + ∂L
∂u · δu + ∂W in
∂u · δu + ∂W ex
∂u · δu
]
dt = 0 ∀δu (48)
such that the Euler equation constitutes after integration by parts as
d
dt
∂L
∂˙u − ∂L
∂u = ∂W in
∂u + ∂W ex
∂u (49)
when we postulate vanishing variations at the arbitrarily chosen time pointst0 and t1 which deﬁned the interval,
i.e., δu(t0) = δu(t1) = 0. The relation ( 49) provides an equivalent formulation of Newton’s law
f = m ¨u (50)
with the (conservative and non-conservative) resultant forces f .
5 Hamilton’s principle

In analogy to rigid particles, the action functional can be assigned for each material point in continuous
deformable bodies as

5.2 The classical Hamilton functional for conservative continua
Classically, Hamilton’s functional equals the action functional A when the reduced energy theorem K =
− E + W + cint is inserted into the second term in
∫
τ(K + K) dt in (53), yielding
Hclassical :=
∫
τ
(K − E + W + cint) dt . (54)
The integration constant cint does not affect the following results and can be set arbitrarily to zero. The reduced
energy theorem neglects thermal contributions by dropping Q such that it is restricted to isothermal processes.
Consequently, the free energy in (8) reduces toE =
∫
/Omega1ρ(0) ¯/Psi1dV . Making use of the formula for the mechanical
work W in (11), we obtain for Hamilton’s functional in its classical sense
Hclassical =

We introduce the total potential to be deﬁned as

the current boundary conditions. Consequently, by inserting ( 56)i n t o(55), we obtain
Hclassical =
∫
τ
(
K − G
)
dt . (57)
Assuming stationarity for Hclassical with respect to the only remaining variable, which are the displacements
u, Hamilton’s functional corresponds to the representation of the action in ( 41) for conservative continuous
deformable bodies. Note the similarity to the principle of the minimum of the total potential energy: however,
whereas the Hamilton principle only demands stationarity of ( 57), the principle of minimum potential energy
requires minimizers. In practice, this leads to the same conditions as only the ﬁrst variation is analyzed for
both cases. Making use of the potentials /Pi1
in and /Pi1ex,( 57) can be represented by
Hclassical =
∫
τ
(
K − /Pi1in − /Pi1ex

5.3 The classical Hamilton principle
Comparably to the axiom of stationary action for rigid particles, Hamilton’s principle in its classical sense
reads
Hclassical → statu ⇔ δuHclassical = 0 ∀δu . (59)
Computation of the Gâteaux derivative results in

∫

(
n(0) · PT − t⋆( 0)

· δu d A = 0 (61)
which yields the balance of linear momentum and Cauchy’s theorem as boundary condition. Consequently,
the classical Hamilton’s principle can be interpreted as a generalization of the principle of stationary action.
Conversely, the principle of stationary action constitutes a special case of the classical Hamilton principle
when deformations are neglected (rigid bodies).

5.4 The extended Hamilton functional for non-conservative continua
The restriction to isothermal processes of Hamilton’s functional in its classical form according to ( 57)a l s o
prevents to account directly for dissipation due to microstructure evolution. Consequently, we propose to
replace one K by the entire energy, thus K =− E + W + Q + cint. This yields
H =
∫
τ
(
K − E + W + Q + cint
)
dt (62)
where consideration of the thermal work Q indicates the extension of the classical Hamilton functional. For
other coupled problems, the replacement of one kinetic energy term has to be adapted according to the respective
form of energy conservation, i.e., taking into account Poynting’s theorem which includes Joule heating [ 49],
for instance. Inserting the formulas for internal energy
E, mechanical work W and thermal work Q introduced
in Eqs. ( 8), (11), and (15), and setting cint = 0, we obtain for Hamilton’s functional

In contrast to the classical form of Hamilton’s functional according to ( 57), the extended form in ( 64)a l s o
accounts for non-isothermal contributions which covers both conservative and non-conservative processes that
are accompanied by changes of the state variable θ. This extension, as we will show in the following, allows
to derive ﬁeld equations for all physical state variables including temperature and internal variables.
For the following derivations, it is beneﬁcial to reformulate
H. To this end, let us make use of the entropy

when mass conservation ˙ρ(0) = 0 is considered. As already mentioned above, the antiderivative
∫
θ/Delta1s dt
does not exist as rational mathematical formula: application of the fundamental theorem of calculus would
suppress the path-dependence of the entropy production. Consequently, the antiderivative has to be modeled
appropriately if necessary. Finally, inserting ( 66)i n t o(64) yields the

which is valid for thermo-mechanically coupled problems and dissipative microstructure evolution.
It is worth mentioning that the presentation of Hamilton’s functional in ( 67) includes antiderivatives with
respect to time, i.e.,
∫
•dt, which constitutes a generalization of Hamilton’s functional in the classical sense,
where only isothermal processes have been accounted for. Consequently, the unspeciﬁc time integrals are not
present in the classical form. However, they resemble methods using time-incremental variations, see, e.g.,
[41,42,53].

5.5 The extended Hamilton principle for non-conservative continua
The extended Hamilton principle for non-conservative continua postulates that Hamilton’s functional in ( 67)
tends to be stationary for the state variables. Usually, the stationarity conditions with respect to displacements
and internal variables are investigated. However, we propose that the stationarity conditions with respect to
all state variables shall be investigated. This, obviously, comprises the stationarity condition with respect to
temperature. Then, the stationarity is recast in formulas as
H → stat
u,θ,α
⇔ δH = δuH + δθH + δαH = 0 ∀δu,δ θ ,δα . (68)
Since the variations of u, θ,a n dα are independent, the necessary conditions for stationarity constitute as
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
δuH = 0 ∀δu
δθH = 0 ∀δθ
δαH = 0 ∀δα
. (69)
This set of equations describes, in a uniﬁed way, the evolution of the thermomechanical state of solids, given
in terms of {u,θ, α}. Let us evaluate the stationarity conditions by computing the Gâteaux derivatives with
respect to u, θ,a n dα. They read

It is worth mentioning that the balance of linear momentum in ( 71) is identical to the one which
results from Hamilton’s principle in its classical form, which is equivalent to the stationarity of the
total potential in the quasi-static case, i.e. ¨u ≈ 0. However, the stationarity of the extended Hamilton
functional yields also the heat equation in ( 72). Here, two heat sources are present without any further
assumptions: i) the heat production due to microstructure evolution; and ii) the thermo-elastic coupling
term 2θ∂S
∂θ : ˙C. Note that the classical form of the heat conduction equation results if the dependence
