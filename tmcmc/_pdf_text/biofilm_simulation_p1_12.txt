Abstract
Biofilms are complex structures which are inhabited by numerous amount of different species
of microorganisms. Due to their ubiquity, they influence human life on an everyday basis. It
is therefore important to understand the interactions between different biofilm components and
reactions to outside conditions. For this purpose, mathematical models and in silico experiments
have proven themselves to be fundamental. In combination within vitro and in vivo experiments,
they can give more insights and focus researchers’ attention, reducing costs in the process. In this
work, a comprehensive multi-species continuum-based biofilm model is presented. This model
is capable of replicating a variety of different biofilm interactions with an arbitrary number of
species, while still being comprehensive to encourage usage by researchers less familiar with
mathematical modeling. In addition to a nutrient source, antibiotic agents and their effect on
the biofilm can also be depicted. The model is derived using Hamilton’s principle of stationary
action, ensuring thermodynamic consistency automatically. The results show good quantitative
agreement with biofilm behavior.
Keywords: biofilm, multi-species, biofilm interaction, continuum model
1 Introduction
The necessity to model and simulate biofilm behavior stems from the ubiquity of microbial
biofilms. It is estimated that half of the existing biomass are prokaryotes [30, 6]. Much of that
mass is located in dense biofilm communities, containing hundreds of species, i.e., upwards of 500
different species in dental biofilms [10, 18]. In these multi-species systems, complex interactions
and relationships between different species emerge [23, 8]. The first, theoretical interaction is
Neutralism, if biofilms do not interact at all with each other. With a lack of enough resources,
i.e., space, nutrients or other necessary compounds, different species of bacteria have to compete
with each other. Often times, the biofilm is then dominated by one species, but other ones
persist in the biofilm [8]. If both species benefit from the presence of one another, it is called
Protocooperation. This has been demonstrated often in biofilms [8]. Other interactions are Al-
lelopathy [25], where one species produces chemicals, which in turn influence the others. This
can lead to Ammensalism, where one species harms the other and Commensalism, where one

species benefits from the other. These interactions lead to the stabilization of the biofilm [8].
To control harmful and use beneficial biofilms, an understanding of the underlying principles is
necessary, but the large number of interactions pose a challenge for in vitro experiments [24].
Mathematical models can provide an environment where hypotheses can be tested rapidly and
connections between different aspects can be drawn. Additionally, an in silico experiment, i.e.,
a simulation, takes considerably less time than an in vitro or an in vivo experiment. Models
based on mathematical descriptions have thus proven themselves to be a viable tool in analyz-
ing complicated processes [3]. Prominent modeling approaches are Individual Based Modeling
(IbM), cellular automaton (CA) and continuum-based modeling. IbM seems to be the natural
approach since the biofilm itself consists of individual particles. Behaviors like cell divisions and
interactions between two cells can be modeled directly as an interaction between two individual
particles. There exist several open-source software systems using this approach, such as Bac-
Sim [13], Infobiotics Workbench [2], iDynoMiCS [15], Simbiotics [21], and NUFEB [16]. IbM
models containing multiple species have been used to study the effects of EPS [12] as well as
detachment and sloughing [31, 32] on multi species biofilm. In combination with the contin-
uum approach, physical factors, like nutrient gradients, have been included [23, 20]. To avoid
the stochastic effects resulting from the randomized placement of the individual particles in the
modeling approach of IbM, the same simulation has to be repeated or it can be combined with
cellular automata rules, see [14]. Multi-species models based fully on cellular automata are, for
example, [19, 27, 28]. Another way of modeling biofilm is the continuum approach. Here, the in-
corporation of governing laws from physics comes naturally. Thermodynamic consistency can be
assured automatically when using the right modeling approach. The thermodynamics and me-
chanics of growth are discussed in detail by [4] and [17]. Additionally, continuum-based models
are deterministic, stochastic effects are thus not present and models do not need additional runs
to average out random effects before conclusions can be drawn. Although the derivation of these
models can be more complex, analytical studies can be performed to compare and characterize
model results [1]. The complexity of these models makes them very predictive, but also hard to
understand, especially for researchers not familiar with material modeling. Easier models can
focus the attention on more important and relevant aspects of biofilm formation and growth,
as well as species interaction. Multi-species continuum-based models in literature, which are
suitable to model an arbitrary number of species, i.e., [29, 1], link the species via shared re-
sources as space and nutrient available. This means that only competition between the species
can be depicted. Models, which can depict Protocooperation, solve the problem of interaction
with an additional interaction variable, which developes where one or both species are present
and enhance the growth process of the other species [26, 5]. For a small number of species, i.e.,
dual-species systems, this is a suitable approach, but since for every interaction between two
species an interaction variable is necessary, the number of internal variables and consequently
the computational cost becomes unreasonable when the number of species increases.
In this work, a continuum model is presented which provides a framework for integrating a the-
oretically arbitrary number of species into the biofilm. It is capable of displaying a wide variety
of possible interactions from mutually inhibitory species to a symbiotic relationship. The inte-
gration of interaction is done via a constant interaction matrix. Thus, no additional internal
variables need to be introduced. The model is derived from Hamilton’s principle of station-
ary action, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. The energy density function is modeled to be
comprehensive. The complexity of the model stems from the dissipation function, which is for-
mulated as a function of the product of the internal variables. It thus interconnects the governing
evolution equations leading to complex material behavior.
The article is structured as follows. In Section 2, the mathematical derivation of the model is
presented. The necessary variables and assumptions are introduced and the governing equations

are shown. In Section 3, a numerical study displaying the behavior of the models with differ-
ent numbers of species, initial conditions and parameters is presented to show the versatility
of the model. The last chapter, Section 4, gives a short conclusion and an outlook for future
investigations possible with this model.
2 Mathematical description
In this work, a comprehensive model for biofilm growth and death is presented. An arbitrary
number of species with interactions can be modeled. The model is derived based on Hamilton’s
principle of stationary action. Hamilton’s principle provides a physically sound way of material
modelling, in particular, the automatic fulfillment of the first and second law of thermodynamics
through the derivation of the model from a potential [9]. Thus, the biofilm model presented in
this work is thermodynamically consistent. In addition, necessary constraints can be considered
in Hamilton’s principle simply by adding corresponding potentials. Hamilton’s principle for a
quasi-static and isothermal process is given by [9, 11] as
(1) H “

.
The Hamilton functional H consists of three parts: the total potential G, the constraint func-
tional C and the dissipation energy D. Hamilton’s principle states that H is stationary for all
thermodynamic state variables. In this case, the thermodynamic state variables are the internal
variables ξ and the Lagrange multiplier γ.
In the following, the individual parts are described in more detail. The total potential G is given
as

To arrive at a sensible description of a predictive model for biofilm growth and death, suitable

model assumptions have to be made, which will be explained in the following.

In order to model the growth as well as the death of biofilm, a second state variable per biofilm

Therefore, the volume covered by living bacteria of species i is

The amount of dead cells is consequently τi :“ ϕi p1 ´ ψiq with i P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , nu.
Since the total volume of all bacteria plus the empty space cannot exceed the available volume,
the holonomic constraint

has to be fulfilled at all times. Since the model is formulated as a material point model, inter-
preting the empty space as physical voids or channels within the biofilm would be inappropriate.
The empty space variable ϕ0 rather serves as a numerical auxiliary quantity used to enforce the
holonomic volume constraint given by Equation (9)
The nutrients are modeled by a given variable c ‹, and the antibiotics by the given variable α‹.
Both are possibly time-dependent. Since living bacteria thrive with nutrients and the percentage
of living bacteria reduces with antibiotics present, the energy density function is modeled as

allow to specify the effect of nutrients and antibiotics on each species. Furthermore, the off-
diagonal entries of the matrix A describe how the different species of bacteria interact with
one another, i.e., if they promote or impair each others growth. While in principle the entries
of the matrices can have any form, i.e., be a function of any parameters or variables of the
model, for simplicity reasons a zero-order Taylor series, i.e., a constant, is chosen to represent
the interactions with nutrients and antibiotics. Hereby, a positive value indicates an equally
favorable, a negative value an equally disadvantageous interaction. The interaction between two
species is consequently modeled with a single scalar with no need for additional state variables
as in [26]. This modeling choice vastly decreases simulation time.
The dissipated energy is modeled as

The dissipation function is the sum of two parts. The first part describes the dissipation due to
the change in living biofilm. Due to the living biofilm being the product of the two state variables
¯ϕi “ ϕiψi, the rates of the internal variables 9ϕ and 9ψ are directly linked together. This allows for
complicated, non-linear effects in the model. Using only the first term of the dissipation function
would lead to a rank-deficient system of differential equations. The second term depending only
on the rate of the volume fraction of each biofilm leads to a full rank. The overall resulting
behavior is rate-dependent.

The variable describing the empty space ϕ0 is described through the constraint in Equation (9).
The model was implemented using Wolfram Mathematica [7] in an implicit framework on a
material point. Therefore, the governing Equation (16), Equation (17) and Equation (18) are
solved using Newton’s method at each time step. The volume constraint (9) is enforced by
means of a Lagrange multiplicator γ. To enforce ϕi, ψi P r0, 1s, the barrier method is used with
a penalty parameter Kp,i “ ηi 10´4 [22].
3 Numerical results
Several numerical experiments were performed to investigate the behavior of the model. First, a
model with two species was chosen. This minimal model helps in understanding the interaction
between different variables. For further investigation, a four species model was implemented.
The four species model allows for a more thorough investigation of the model as well as showing
more complex behaviors. The time step size ∆ t is set constant to ∆ t “ 10´4 T ime throughout
the numerical experiments. The unit of time can be chosen to represent an appropriate timescale
for biofilm growth and has to be determined in subsequent in vitro experiments.
3.1 Two species
For the two species model, five cases are investigated. They differ in the parameters listed in
Table 1.

The results from the first test case are depicted in Figure 1a and Figure 1b. Figure 1a shows the
plot of the state variables ϕ and ψ over time. The amount of biofilm present from a species ϕi is
given with a solid colored line. The empty space ϕ0 is shown in black. The dashed line represents
the percentage of living bacteria of a given species ψi. In this first test case, the only interaction
between both species is due to the limited amount of space available, since the non-diagonal
terms of the growth parameter matrix A are set to zero. The diagonal entries of the growth
parameters matrix are chosen to be a11 ą a22. This results in a faster growth rate of species 1.
Once the empty space converges to zero, kinks in the graphs emerge and the volume fraction ϕ2
drops down rapidly. As soon as the volume fraction of species 2 reaches a value close to zero, its
percentage of living cells ψ2 drops down. Similar effects can be observed in the results of test

case 2 in Figure 2a and Figure 2b. In this test case, the viscosity of the species ηi differs. A
higher viscosity leads to a slower reaction of the biofilm. The simulation time is thus elongated
to be 1500 time steps. The aforementioned model behaviors from case 1 are also visible and even
more prominent. While in case 1 the amount of species 2 ϕ2 is already at a low percentage of
around 10% and still declining before the empty space reaches zero. In case 2, ϕ2 is at roughly
30% and ascending. The different amounts of species 2 present, result in different reaction from
species 1. In the first case, the slope of the ϕ1-curve changes only slightly, while in case 2 a
prominent kink is observable. The drop in the percentage of living bacteria of species 2 ψ2 is
comperable for both cases, as is the converged steady state solution.

When interactions between the species are enabled via aij ‰ 0 for i ‰ j, as it is in test case 3,
the survival of the other species is favorable for both species. An equilibrium between the two
species emerges, where none gets extinguished. This can be observed in the result of test case 3
in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.

For antibiotics sensitive biofilms, longer simulation times are necessary as well. It can be observed
in Figure 4a and Figure 5a, that the percentage of living species ψi drops initially. Although the
sensitivity for antibiotics of species 2 is higher than that of species 1, due to the higher initial
condition, species 2 can prevail over species 1 in the fourth test case. If the difference of initial
biofilm is closer, as it is in test case 5, it is not enough and species 1 prevails instead. This can
be seen in Figure 5a. The amount of living bacteria of each species ¯ϕi “ ϕiψi can be observed
for both cases in Figure 4b and Figure 5b. In all cases above, the interaction between different
species of biofilm is modeled with a positive integer to model cooperative behavior. To model
competition, a negative value for the off-diagonal entries of the interaction matrixA can be used.

===== PAGE 9 =====
The results of this simulation are shown in Figure 6. It can be observed, that the slower reacting
species 2, i.e., the species with a higher viscosity ηi, comes out dominant. While a faster reaction
is advantageous while reacting to nutrients, it can be detrimental when reacting negatively to
another species. Early in the simulation, the percentage of living bacteria of species 1 ψ1 drops
of faster than the the living percentage of species 2 ψ2. This leads to a difference in volume
growth, where the species 2 with more living cells flourishes. The drop off in percentage of living
cells is different from the experiment, where no interactions is present (c.f. Figure 1). There is
no negative part in the driving force in these simulation, thus the percentage of living cells ψi
stays at a relatively high level.

3.2 Four Species
In theory, an arbitrary number of species can be inserted into the model. For this study, a
biofilm consisting of four species is considered. The growth parameter matrix A stays the
same throughout all numerical experiments in this chapter, as do the viscosities ηi, only the
antibiotic sensitivity parameters bi as well as the nutrient concentration c‹ and the concentration
of antibiotics α‹ are changed. The values for the symmetric growth coefficient matrix A and the

Figure 8: Result of the second test case with four species. The initial volume fractions of species
ϕi differ. Species 1, 2 and 3 start with an an initial volume fraction of ϕ1 “ ϕ2 “ ϕ3 “ 0.02,
species 4 starts with ϕ4 “ 0.2
In Figure 7 and Figure 8, the results can be seen. The first case shows all four species with the
same initial biofilm concentration. Since the antibiotic sensitivity differs in all four species, with
species 1 being the most sensitive and species 4 being the least sensitive, the initial drop in living
percentage of each species ψi is also different. Species 4 is the only species with a minimum of
20% of its cells still living. Due to the greater growing parameter of the first species, however, in
the course of the simulation, the first species takes over as the dominant species in the biofilm.
The different viscosities ηi determine how fast each species grows. This can be seen in Figure 7a
and Figure 8a, where the first species’ gradient in the beginning is much greater than that of

each other species. The second case investigated here only differs in the initial conditions, i.e.,
the fourth species gets a head start in the simulation. Since there is now less free space available
to all species of biofilm, the equilibrium between all species is reached earlier. In addition to
that, by the last time step, species 4 still has more volume than species 3, which, in the prior
experiment, had more. For the nutrients, as well as the antibiotics, an arbitrary function can
be implemented. In the following test case, the nutrients were applied with a Sine function (see
Figure 9a). The results can be seen in Figure 10a and Figure 10b. The general shape of the
results roughly mimics these from Figure 7a, with the exception of the fluctuation due to little
(or no) nutrients in the system.

For the final case investigated, the sensitivity towards antibiotics was adjusted. The first species
now has a high sensitivity of b1 “ 10, while the fourth species is almost resistant against an-
tibiotics with b4 “ 0.01. After one-third of the simulation time, antibiotics are inserted into the
system (see Figure 9b). Every species, except the resistant species 4, almost immediately dies, as
can be observed in Figure 11a and Figure 11b. After the insertion of antibiotics, resistant species
4 takes over the space which was inhabited by the other species prior to the insertion. The second
species, which is not as sensitive to antibiotics but has a smaller viscosity than species 4, i.e.
η2ăη4, and is thus more reactive to changes in the system, regains some space but is ultimately
dominated by the fourth species. In this example, cooperative behavior is not the dominating
factor of species survival. The resistance against antibiotics is more important.

4 Conclusion and outlook
In this work, a new multi-species biofilm model is presented. In principle, an arbitrary number
of species can be described using this model. For the description, one internal variable is needed
to describe the empty space as well as two additional internal variables for each biofilm. In
this work, biofilm is modeled with the variables of the volume fraction of all, living and dead,
biofilm ϕ, as well as the percentage of living cells inside the volume fraction ψ. This leads to
the amount of living cells given by ¯ϕ “ ϕψ. The interactions between each species are modeled
with energies. For the evolution of biofilm, a dissipated function is introduced as a function of
the living bacteria ¯ϕ and thus a product of the internal state variables, leading to a coupled
system of evolution equations, capable of non-linear effects. The free energy density is modeled
with little assumptions concerning the growth and death of biofilm. Nevertheless, the model is
capable of producing complex results. Many behaviors as observed in multi-species biofilm can
be modeled. The reduced number of parameters of the model simplifies the pending validation
of the model with in vitro experiments. The model is also suitable for further investigation of
biofilm behavior, for example, accounting for stochastic properties.
